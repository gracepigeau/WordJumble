# Word Jumble
A puzzle game where hidden word is placed at random in a 2D array of random, lower case letters

# Motivation
Project is/was created for CISC 320 at Queen's University for Professor McLeod in 2017.

# Use
To play the game, the user supplies a word (lowercase) between 3-10 characters in length, and chooses a difficulty level from "easy", "medium" or "hard". These levels control the size of the puzzle, which will be a square array of 2, 3 or 4 times the size of the supplied word. The word provided by the user is placed at random in a 2D array of lower case letters. The word can go up (North), down (South), left (West), or right (East), but not diagonallly. The user is timed to try to find the word, to guess the user must enter the column and row of the first letter and the direction in which it is spelt ("n", "e", "s", or "w").
